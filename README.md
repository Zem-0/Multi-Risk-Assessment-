# Multi-Risk-Assessment-
## Project Description

### Multi Risk Assessment

The Multi Risk Assessment app is a comprehensive health risk prediction tool developed using machine learning models and Python. This app provides users with a platform to assess their risk for several health conditions including breast cancer, liver disease, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. By inputting specific health metrics, users can receive predictions on their condition and gain insights through real-time graphs that compare their input values with mean values.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear model descriptions and visual feedback to help users understand their health risks. Each model has been trained on relevant datasets to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
